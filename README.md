# Snippet Storage

# Project Goals
This project was my first time using Django framework with Python to create a web app.  I created a project to allow the sharing and storing of code snippets.  It was designed to be a multi user platform to enable a community to share different code snippets with different coding languages. The idea was to create a database of code snippets that could be used by new and vetern coders alike.  

## To Dos
* Create User Profile page
* Counting feature for snippets introduced
* Copy and storage feature for other users snippets
* Rating feature for snippets
* Comment feature on code snippets
